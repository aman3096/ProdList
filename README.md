# ProdList
Interface takes up information from user and displays in the form of dynamic list. Built using MERN stack (work in progress)

There are 2 parts. Backend contains the server built using express.js and outside is the frontend folder built on React. I have used axios for getting GET,POSt 
requests from server, bootstrap for looking of basic project, I have used mongoDB for building schema, model and interation with database.
for frontend project create a new react project using command 
  >create-react-app <app-name>
  and then install the dependencies required for the project using command.
    >npm install 
    this will install all the dependencies that is needed for the project,
    For backend part first run 
      >npm install
    This would install the dependencies required for the project. 
    Copy the files theand run the project after reaching to the location where the appjs is present and run the project using command
    >node app
